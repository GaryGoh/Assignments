Fields of Athenry
"Michael, they have taken you away.
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing,
Its so lonely round the fields of Athenry.

Fields of Athenry
"Michael, they have taken you away.
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Low lie the fields of Athenry,
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing,
Its so lonely round the fields of Athenry.=====================================
The Banks of My Own Lovely Lee
=====================================

How oft do my thoughts in their fancy take flight
To the home of my childhood away,
To the days when each patriot’s vision seem’d bright
Ere I dreamed that those joys should decay.
When my heart was as light as the wild winds that blow
Down the Mardyke through each elm tree,
Where I sported and play’d ’neath each green leafy shade
On the banks of my own lovely Lee.
